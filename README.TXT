This is a Java program with the purpose of extracting and analyzing Pubmed articles about Diabetes.
 *  
 *  Here are the key tasks executed by the program:
 *  - Retrieve at least 10 different pages of text from Pubmed
 *  - Clean, tokenize and normalize the page to optimally get only the actual textual content
 *  - Represent the pages as vectors of binary values, using a simple hashing trick (token is present in the article or not).
 *  - Run a simple (1 iteration) K-means implementation built from scratch, to cluster those pages into 3 groups
 *  - Present results and discuss briefly some similarities between the pages in the same cluster
 *  - Identify key characteristics of pages in different clusters
 *  
 *  If you have any questions or suggestions, please send an email to dr.tournier@gmail.com

 *  Thank you!
 
 * PS - You will also find here a POC (Proof of Concept) on how to implement a simple K-Means Cluster model in Excel from 
 * scratch. Have fun!
